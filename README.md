# AI Question Paper Research Agent

## Project Description

This project implements an AI-powered research agent designed to assist students and educators in compiling comprehensive question banks from past examination papers. By leveraging Google Gemini for natural language understanding, DuckDuckGo Search for web scraping, and PyPDF/ReportLab for PDF processing and generation, the agent automates the tedious process of finding, extracting, organizing, and formatting exam questions.

## Features

- **Syllabus Parsing**: Upload a PDF syllabus, and the agent will parse its content to understand the course structure and modules.
- **Web Search for Question Papers**: Automatically searches the web (using DuckDuckGo) for previous year's question papers based on the provided university and subject.
- **PDF Download & Text Extraction**: Downloads identified PDF question papers and extracts their textual content.
- **AI-Powered Question Extraction**: Utilizes the Google Gemini model to intelligently identify and extract individual questions from the raw text of question papers, filtering out irrelevant content like instructions, marks, and headers.
- **Intelligent Segregation & Deduplication**: Gemini further processes the extracted questions by:
    - Segregating them into relevant modules based on the uploaded syllabus.
    - Identifying semantically similar or repeated questions and marking them as 'IMPORTANT' with a count of repetitions.
- **Formatted PDF Output**: Generates a professionally formatted PDF document containing the organized question bank, complete with module headers and highlighted important questions.
- **Gradio User Interface**: Provides an intuitive web-based interface built with Gradio for easy interaction.

## How to Use

### 1. Setup

Before running the application, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install gradio google-generativeai ddgs pypdf reportlab
```

### 2. Google Gemini API Key

You will need a Google Gemini API Key to use the AI capabilities of this agent. 

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Create an API Key.
3. In your Colab notebook, add your API key to the secrets manager (accessible via the "🔑" icon in the left panel) and name it `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. Alternatively, you can directly input it into the Gradio UI.

### 3. Running the Application

Execute all the code cells in the provided Jupyter Notebook (or Python script if you've extracted it). This will launch the Gradio web interface.

```python
# This is typically the last cell in your notebook
app.launch(debug=True)
```

### 4. Using the Interface

Once the Gradio app is running, you will see a web interface with the following fields:

- **Enter Google Gemini API Key**: Provide your Gemini API key here.
- **University Name**: Enter the full name of the university (e.g., "Pune University").
- **Subject**: Enter the subject name (e.g., "Operating Systems").
- **Upload Syllabus (PDF)**: Upload the PDF file containing the syllabus for the subject.

Click the "Find & Compile Questions" button to start the research process. The "Agent Status Logs" will show the progress, and upon completion, a "Download Compiled PDF" link will appear.
